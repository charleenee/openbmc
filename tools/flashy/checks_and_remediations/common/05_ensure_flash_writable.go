// A check for verified boot systems where the second flash is unwritable.

// On vboot BMCs the first chip is intended to be read-only in hardware and
// contains the Golden Image.  The second chip is intended to be read-write. 
// Some possible & obvious reasons this could go wrong:
//
// - the chips were installed in the wrong slots during manufacture.
// - the chips were erroneously swapped during repair (this is a valid
//   repair flow for non-vboot BMCs, though).
// - two read-only chips were installed.
//
// If the second chip is read-only, it's not possible to flash the BMC here. 
// Rebooting the BMC could have unpredictable consequences.  Leave these
// BMCs in place for later detection and repair.
//
// NB: it's conceivable that a non-vboot BMCs could boot up without an mtd
// partition for the U-Boot environment, so skip the check on those.
